The project with Prof. Xie is to find the optimal prediction model from logistic regression, tree-based model (random forest, XGBoost), K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Neural Network based models ( Multi-layer Perceptron MLP), multinomial naive bayes (MNB).
Run Data_Analytics_split.R before running any other specifical model codes.
